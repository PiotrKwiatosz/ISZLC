IT System for the Management of Cytotoxic Drugs

Need of a solution to streamline the management process in a hospital pharmacy where is located a cytotoxic drug laboratory.

    The process of document flow in the work of a hospital department and pharmacy - 
    Laboratory of cytotoxic drugs

Manual rewriting and documenting can lead to illegibility issues as well as transcription and processing errors. There is also a risk of losing documents, multiple copies and incomplete documentation.

Electronic documentation workflows enable healthcare professionals instant access to the information they need and the most up-to-date information. When integrated with other medical information systems, such as electronic medical records, it enables full supervision over the path of patient care. Job analysis is easier when this information is stored electronically.

    Physician prescription module (Doctor module)

will provide clear, complete prescriptions that will be automatically sent to the pharmacy.

    Pharmacist prescription fulfillment module (Pharmacist module)

By connecting to the physician prescription module, it will allow the cytotoxic laboratory to:

    •   see the workload for this day and future days and plan your work accordingly.
    •   automatically prioritize the most urgent prescriptions,
    •   provide supervision over the processes (monitored and analyzed, which may enable the identification of problems)
    •   real-time supervision of drug stocks in the laboratory
    •   will advise the pharmacist to use the appropriate vial size and the stability date of the preparation.

All this will allow the laboratory staff to focus on clinical work, audit and quality management.

    Cytotoxic drugs mixing module (Pharmacist module)

Oncology Drug Mixing Process:

1. Volumetric is the mixing of intravenous oncology drugs using volumetric methods. Requires a high concentration level by a single ingredient or a second inspector to manually verify the accuracy of the preparation steps during the mixing process. This gravimetric-volumetric mixing uses technology to carry out verification with an electronic balance and the known density of each ingredient.

2. Gravimetric systems confirm electronically the accuracy of prepared volumes and prepared doses. This reduces the need for manual verification of the volume prepared doses. The scales can accurately measure the remaining amount of the drug and the system will calculate a new stability date and return it to the electronic warehouse. A unique barcode label is printed detailing the quantity remaining and the expiration date to enable it to be physically returned to the warehouse. This vial can now be used for future preparation.

    Drug Delivery Module (Nurse Module)

The use of electronic prescriptions will reduce the number of errors when administered by cancer nurses. It will improve the readability of drug administration documentation and enable standardized nurse-nurse and nurse-doctor communication in the field of drug administration
